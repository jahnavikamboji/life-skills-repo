Workplace sexual harassment is illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. 
Title VII, which applies to employers with 15 or more employees, outlaws two types of sexual harassment:
Quid pro quo harassment:occurs when a supervisor's request for sexual favors or other sexual conduct results in a tangible job action.
Examples include "I'll give you the promotion if you sleep with me" or "I'll fire you unless you go out with me."
Hostile work environment:occurs when an employee is subjected to unwelcome physical or verbal conduct of a sexual nature that is so severe or pervasive as to alter the employee's working conditions or create an abusive work environment.
