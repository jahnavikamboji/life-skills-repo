### Question 1
What is Deep Work?

Deep Work, as defined by Cal Newport, is the practice of focusing without distraction on a cognitively demanding task. It involves intense concentration and effort, allowing you to produce high-quality, valuable work in less time. In contrast to shallow work, which is often fragmented or distracted (such as responding to emails or attending meetings), deep work allows you to engage in tasks that push your cognitive limits, like solving complex problems or creating new, meaningful ideas.
