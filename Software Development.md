#### Question 1
Which point(s) were new to you?

* "Join meetings 5-10 minutes early to get some time with your team members."
This is a great tip for building raport, which isn’t always emphasizes in software development advice.

* "Be available when someone replies to your message."
This is a simple but often overlooked practice. Many people send messages and then go offline, slowing down communication.

* "Make sure you manage your food situation well."
Food affecting concentration isn’t commonly discussed in productivity tips, but it’s very true!

* "Do not miss calls. If you cannot talk immediately, receive the call and inform them you will call back in 5-10 min."
This is a subtle but effective way to improve team trust and communication.

##### Question2
Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

* Encourage deep work for users – I could suggest time-blocking techniques or focus strategies tailored to your workflow.
* Improve structured responses – Instead of just answering quickly, I could provide more actionable steps or frameworks to help you execute ideas better.
* Optimize follow-ups – I could check in on long-term projects or past discussions to ensure consistency.
