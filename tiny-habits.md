1. In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?
Ah, the idea of "tiny habits" to create big changes is an interesting thing to do in life.
You can add new habits to existing routines. For example, after coming home, you  could properly arrange things.
## Easy-to-Start Tiny Habits ##:
Meditate for 30 seconds after waking up.
Write down one thing you’re grateful for before bed.
Drink a glass of water before every meal.


2. How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P?
Motivation: You want to feel calmer and less stressed.
Ability: Start with 1-minute meditations instead of 10 minutes.
Prompt: Meditate right after waking up.
Make the habit super easy to start, especially when motivation is low.
Example: Instead of saying, "I will read 20 pages," say, "I will read one paragraph."
If you feel unmotivated, make the habit more enjoyable.
Example: Play your favorite playlist while working or celebrate small wins to stay excited.
M - Motivation
A - Ability
P - Prompt.


3. Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit).
Celebrating a small success is motivating ourselves, and we can make it more of a habit.
Do a small first pump or a happy dance.
Say “I did it!” out loud.

1. Short-Term Feedback for Long-Term Habits
Celebrate small wins to make the process enjoyable. Immediate rewards help override the delayed gratification problem of good habits.
Writing daily makes you identify as a writer.
The goal isn’t just achieving external success but internal transformation—becoming the kind of person who naturally performs the desired actions.
Gradual Change: The Ship of Theseus
Like the ancient story of the ship, change happens one "plank" at a time. You don’t need to abandon your old self; instead, habits allow you to transform incrementally.
Over time, habits don’t just change your outcomes—they change who you are.


5. What is the book's perspective about Identity?
The habits you maintain are an expression of your current identity.
Identity Drives Long-Term Motivation
When a habit aligns with your identity, it’s intrinsically motivating, not something you need external rewards for.

6. Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?
Reduce Friction
Friction refers to anything that makes it harder to follow through with a habit. The more steps or effort involved, the less likely you are to do it.
Key Insight: "The easier a behavior is, the more likely it is to occur."
Use Technology to Your Advantage
Reduce the Immediate Rewards

7. Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?
Steps to Make the Habit Easier and More Attractive
Make the Cue Obvious:
Set a daily alarm or reminder on my phone in the evening labeled “Reading Time.”
Keep the book visibly next to my morning coffee or tea routine.
Make It Attractive:
Pair reading with a treat, like a cozy blanket, a cup of tea, or sitting in a comfortable spot I enjoy.
Reward myself after finishing a book, such as watching the movie adaptation or buying another exciting book.
Make It Easy:
Keep a short reading goal to reduce the pressure of spending a lot of time up front.
Download books to my phone or Kindle so I always have access, even when I’m not at home.
Make the Response Satisfying:
Share my progress with friends or in a book club for accountability and encouragement.

8. Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?
Make the Cue Invisible:
Keep all snack foods out of sight, such as placing them in a cupboard or pantry that is harder to access at night.
Make the Process Unattractive:
Remind myself of the negative consequences of late-night snacking, such as disrupted sleep or feeling sluggish the next day.##
## Make It Hard ##:
Store snacks in a location that requires more effort to access, like a storage box with a lid that I’d have to take extra time to open.
Make the Response Unsatisfying:
Replace the habit with a more satisfying alternative, like drinking herbal tea or doing a relaxing activity like reading.
Gradually increase the time between dinner and bedtime to create a routine where late-night snacking feels unnecessary.
