### Question1
What is the Feynman Technique? Explain in 1 line?

The Feynman Technique is a four-step learning method where you simplify a concept by teaching it in plain language, identify gaps in your understanding, and refine your explanation for clarity.

### Question2 
In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

One of the most interesting ideas in the video is how Salvador Dalí and Thomas Edison used micro-naps to tap into their diffuse mode of thinking. They would hold objects (keys for Dalí, ball bearings for Edison) while relaxing, and as they drifted off, the objects would fall, wake them up, and allow them to capture fresh ideas from their subconscious.

### Question3
What are active and diffused modes of thinking?
* Active Mode: This is when you concentrate deeply on a specific task or concept, using well-established neural pathways. It’s useful for solving familiar problems and processing detailed information.

* Diffuse Mode: This is a more relaxed, big-picture thinking state, where your brain makes broader connections between ideas. It helps with creativity, problem-solving, and understanding complex or new concepts.

### Question4
According to the video, what are the steps to take when approaching a new topic? Only mention the points.

* Deconstruct the skill : Break it down into smaller parts.
* Learn enough to self-correct : Use a few resources but avoid over-researching.
* Remove barriers to practice : Eliminate distractions.
* Practice for at least 20 hours : Push through the frustration barrier.


### Question5
Minimize distractions: Follow the principle of "Work when you work, play when you play." This means creating an environment that supports deep focus, such as keeping your phone on silent, removing non-work-related notifications, and using tools like TimeLimit distractions.

Track and manage your time: Use tools like Boosted to track how much time you're spending on tasks, helping you stay on top of deadlines and improve productivity.

Engage deeply with concepts: Approach learning with curiosity. Instead of rushing to complete assignments, focus on understanding the underlying concepts. Ask yourself questions like "Where is this concept used?" and "Can I explain this concept in my own words?"

Implement and teach: Reinforce your understanding by implementing the concepts in code or design. Once you feel confident, try explaining the concept to someone else, as this demonstrates mastery.

Be proactive in communicating: If you encounter obstacles or difficulties, communicate them clearly and proactively. This will help in getting timely support and in refining your approach.

Set realistic deadlines: Use deadlines as a tool to allocate time effectively, but don’t let them distract from the goal of mastering the concept.

Make learning fun: Find ways to make the learning process enjoyable, such as gamifying your progress or collaborating with others on projects.
